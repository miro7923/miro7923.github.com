<h2 id="컴퓨터-사이언스의-기원">컴퓨터 사이언스의 기원<br /></h2>
<ul>
  <li>컴퓨터 사이언스는 컴퓨터라고 하는 기기에 대한 연구라고 할 수 있다.<br /></li>
  <li>컴퓨터 사이언스의 현대적인 기원은 1940년대에 최초로 출현한 디지털 컴퓨터들의 등장과 1930년대에 이와는 별도로 형성된 계산기기들에 대한 적절한 수학적 모델에 있다고 할 수 있다. 컴퓨터는 그 전까지는 수작업으로 하던 덧셈과 뺄셈같은 계산들을 좀 더 빠르면서 정확하게 처리하고자 만든 장치에서 시작되었기 때문이다. <br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="컴퓨터-사이언스의-정의">컴퓨터 사이언스의 정의<br /></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>물리학은 에너지와 많은 관련성을 갖는 학문이다. 반면, 컴퓨터 사이언스는 정보의 표현, 저장, 조작 및 검색과 밀접한 관계를 갖는 학문이다. <br />
물리학이 에너지 변환장치를 이용하는 것처럼, 컴퓨터 사이언스는 정보변환장치를 이용한다.<br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>컴퓨터 사이언스에서는 정보가 중요하고 그것이 차지하는 비중이 크기 때문에 컴퓨터 사이언스를 정보과학(Information Science)이라고도 한다. 컴퓨터 사이언스는 여러 가지 서로 다른 측면에서 정의할 수 있다. <br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-기기-중심">1. 기기 중심<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>문제를 해결</strong>하기 위한 도구로서의 정의. 컴퓨터 기기와 이를 둘러싼 질문들, 즉 컴퓨터를 어떻게 설계하고 분석하고 구축하고 사용할 것인가 하는 것에 초점이 모아진다.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-정보-중심">2. 정보 중심<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li>컴퓨터에게 <strong>정보(데이터)</strong>의 개념과 처리는 중요하다. 정보 중심 관점에서는 데이터의 표현, 저장, 구성, 전송 및 처리에 관한 질문으로 귀결된다.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-프로그램-중심">3. 프로그램 중심<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>프로그램</strong>이란 어떤 문제를 풀기 위한 컴퓨터 명령어들의 집합이다. 프로그램 중심 관점에서 본다면 컴퓨터 사이언스는 프로그래밍에 관한 연구라고 할 수 있다. 그렇기 때문에 이 관점에서는 프로그램 표현을 위한 적절한 언어의 선택, 프로그램의 정확성과 효율성, 프로그램의 실행을 위한 기계, 그리고 프로그래밍 기술 등과 같은 프로그래밍에 관한 문제점들을 강조한다.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-알고리즘-중심">4. 알고리즘 중심<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>알고리즘</strong>이란 문제 해결을 위한 작업이 어떻게 수행되는지를 정의하는 단계들의 집합니다. 컴퓨터는 알고리즘을 구현하는 기계이고, 정보는 알고리즘이 만들어내는 대상이며, 프로그래밍은 알고리즘을 기술하는 수단이다. 알고리즘 중심 관점에서 본다면 컴퓨터 사이언스는 알고리즘에 관한 연구라고 할 수 있다.<br /></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>👉 이와 같이 컴퓨터 사이언스는 컴퓨터의 설계, 컴퓨터 프로그래밍, 정보 처리, 알고리즘 문제 해결, 알고리즘 처리 자체 등과 같은 다양한 분야에 대한 과학적인 기초를 제공하는 학문이라 할 수 있다.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="1-컴퓨터의-멀티미디어화">1. 컴퓨터의 멀티미디어화<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li>대용량의 사운드, 그래픽, 비디오 등을 지원하는 멀티미디어 PC가 보편화되면서 이에 따라 주변기기들의 성능도 멀티미디어를 잘 처리할 수 있는 수준으로 고성능화, 고용량화되고 있다.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-컴퓨터의-네트워크화">2. 컴퓨터의 네트워크화<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li>인터넷의 보급으로 클라이언트/서버 환경의 확대가 가속화되고 네트워크를 통한 정보의 교환이 급속히 늘어나면서 네트워크 환경에 알맞은 컴퓨터 기술과 더불어 더욱 고급화, 지능화되는 네트위크 기술의 개발과 연구가 가속화 되고 있다.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-모바일-컴퓨팅의-확산">3. 모바일 컴퓨팅의 확산<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li>노트북, PDA, 스마트폰 등 휴대할 수 있는 모바일 컴퓨터들이 확산되고 있는 것에 따라 무선 기술 및 관련 컴퓨팅 기술의 개발과 연구가 확대되고 있다.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-컴퓨터의-임베드화">4. 컴퓨터의 임베드화<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li>컴퓨터 기술과 가전기기가 접합된 시스템을 임베디드(embedded) 시스템이라 한다. TV에 인터넷 접속 기능이 결합된 경우가 대표적이라 할 수 있다.<br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-pc의-고성능화">5. PC의 고성능화<br /></h3>
<ul>
  <li>클러스터링 기법을 활용한 병렬처리 컴퓨터 기술이 접합될 경우 지금의 서버 수준을 뛰어 넘는 고성능 PC가 개발될 것이다.<br /><br /></li>

<p>If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.</p>

<p>Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.</p>

<p>Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.</p>

<p>Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yujin Hwang</name><email>miro7923@gmail.com</email></author><category term="post date" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post has the date disabled.
